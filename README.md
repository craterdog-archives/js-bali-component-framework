### Bali Component Framework
This project provides a JavaScript/NodeJS version of the foundation framework classes for the [_Bali Cloud Environment™_](https://github.com/craterdog-bali/bali-project-documentation/wiki). It implements the [_Bali Document Notation™_](https://github.com/craterdog-bali/bali-project-documentation/wiki/The-Bali-Reference-Guide:-Part-I), which allows your browser to communicate with the Bali Cloud Environment™ similar to the way _JSON_ based web services communicate with each other but using a much more powerful interchange language.

_This project is still in its early stages and the classes and interfaces to the classes are likely to change._
